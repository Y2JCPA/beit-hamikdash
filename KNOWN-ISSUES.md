# Known Issues — V1 MVP

## Critical (Gameplay Broken)
- [ ] **Direction keys inverted** — WASD/arrow keys move opposite direction from expected
- [ ] **Can't walk up the Kevesh (ramp)** — player stays on ground level, no ramp collision
- [ ] **Wrong animal = stuck** — if you buy an animal that doesn't match available korbanot at your level, no way to sell/discard it
- [ ] **Lag/performance** — too many meshes? Need to profile and optimize

## UX Issues
- [ ] **Azara too small** — world feels cramped, expand the courtyard significantly
- [ ] **No sell-back option** — need a way to sell inventory items back to Shimon (at reduced price)
- [ ] **No clear guidance** — first-time player doesn't know what to do or where to go
- [ ] **Level 1 guided mode not guided enough** — steps should glow/highlight in the 3D world

## Visual/Polish
- [ ] General glitchiness — needs thorough testing and cleanup
- [ ] Fire effect is basic boxes — could be improved
- [ ] NPCs are static — no idle animation
- [ ] No sound effects beyond instruments
- [ ] Missing favicon

## Future (V2+)
- [ ] Menachot system
- [ ] Heichal interior
- [ ] Kohen Gadol mode
- [ ] More NPCs (Yisraelim bringing korbanot)
- [ ] Day/night cycle tied to Tamid schedule
